Here’s a line-by-line explanation of this Java code, which checks whether a string is a palindrome using two different methods.

java
Copy code
package Palindrome;
Defines the package Palindrome, which organizes classes. Packages help avoid class name conflicts and make the code modular.
java
Copy code
import java.util.Scanner;
Imports the Scanner class from java.util, allowing us to take user input from the console.
java
Copy code
public class Palindrome {
Declares the main Palindrome class, which contains all the methods for checking palindromes and running the program.
Method 1: checkPalindrome
java
Copy code
public static boolean checkPalindrome(String str) {
Declares the checkPalindrome method, which is public (accessible from outside the class) and static (can be called without creating an instance of Palindrome). It returns a boolean indicating if str is a palindrome.
java
Copy code
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(str);
Creates a StringBuilder object, sb, initialized with the input str. StringBuilder allows for easy string manipulations like reversing.
java
Copy code
    sb.reverse();
Reverses the content of sb. This will store the reversed version of str in sb.
java
Copy code
    String rev = sb.toString();
Converts the reversed sb back to a regular String and assigns it to rev.
java
Copy code
    if(rev.equals(str)) {
        return true;
    }
Compares rev with the original str. If they are equal, str is a palindrome, so the method returns true.
java
Copy code
    return false;
If the strings are not equal, the method returns false, meaning str is not a palindrome.
Method 2: palindrome
java
Copy code
public static boolean palindrome(String s) {
Declares another method, palindrome, which checks if s is a palindrome using recursion. It returns a boolean.
java
Copy code
    int strLength = s.length();
Stores the length of s in the variable strLength.
java
Copy code
    if(strLength <= 1) {
        return true;
    }
Checks if the length of s is 1 or less. A string with one or no characters is a palindrome, so the method returns true.
java
Copy code
    if(s.charAt(0) == s.charAt(strLength - 1)) {
        return palindrome(s.substring(1, strLength - 1));
    }
Checks if the first and last characters of s are equal. If they are, it makes a recursive call to palindrome with a substring of s, excluding the first and last characters. This recursive call checks the next set of characters.
java
Copy code
    return false;
If the first and last characters are not equal, it returns false, meaning s is not a palindrome.
Main Method
java
Copy code
public static void main(String[] args) {
The main method, where the program begins execution.
java
Copy code
    Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
Creates a Scanner object, scan, to read input from the console.
java
Copy code
    System.out.println("Please enter in the word you would like to see if it is a palindrome.");
Prompts the user to enter a word to check if it’s a palindrome.
java
Copy code
    String str = scan.next().toLowerCase();
Reads the next token (word) from the user input, converts it to lowercase (to make the check case-insensitive), and assigns it to str.
java
Copy code
    boolean a = checkPalindrome(str);
    boolean b = palindrome(str);
Calls both checkPalindrome and palindrome methods with str, storing their return values in a and b, respectively.
java
Copy code
    System.out.println(a);
    System.out.println(b);
Prints the results of both palindrome checks to the console.
java
Copy code
    // this is how you comment code in Java
A single-line comment explaining that this is how to add comments in Java.
java
Copy code
    System.out.println("Here I am posting a new line that says what I just wrote " + str);
Prints a line with the user’s inputted word, str, appended to the message.
java
Copy code
}
Ends the main method.
java
Copy code
}
Ends the Palindrome class.
This code provides two methods for checking if a word is a palindrome, with one using string reversal and the other using recursion. It prompts the user for input, performs both checks, and outputs the results.
